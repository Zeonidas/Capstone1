# Capstone1
Springboard Capstone Project 1 - Application Name: Mental Keep

## Background
I've been tasked with presenting 3 ideas to my mentor and receiving approval for one to develop.

### Selected App
I will be developing an application called Mental Keep. This application will be focused on providing a mental health journey journal. The applicaiton will also offer a quick jot section for individuals who just need to vent at the time.
#### Additional Ideas
Creating a Personal Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) that the user can take to see their progress. However no identifiable information can be collected to maintain compliance with HIPAA.
